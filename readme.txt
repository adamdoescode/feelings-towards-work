I lost my job, but maybe not such a bad thing. Below is a graph quantifying how I felt about my job. I tried to note this twice a day from 23rd of Jan 2020 until yesterday when I got laid-off (made redundant? fired?).

I made observations everyday from 23Jan2020 (77 days). Most days I recorded observations twice a day (7am and 9pm) for a total of 152 observations.

Frequencies of work status being reported (n=152):
No work status recorded: 23
Work status was recorded: 129

Frequency of how I felt about work (n=129):
like work: 12 (0.09)
neutral work: 87 (0.67)
dislike work: 30 (0.23)

Conclusion: I did not like my job very much.
